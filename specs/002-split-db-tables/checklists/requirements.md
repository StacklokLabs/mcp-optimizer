# Specification Quality Checklist: Database Table Separation for Registry and Workload MCP Servers

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**All items passed successfully:**

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written in plain language focused on what needs to happen (table separation, matching, relationship management) without mentioning specific technologies like SQLite, SQLAlchemy, or implementation patterns.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. For example:
   - FR-005 clearly states "enforce unique constraint on URL for remote registry MCP servers"
   - FR-012 clearly states "inherit description and embeddings from linked registry servers"
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist

3. **Success Criteria Quality**: All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001: "1000 registry MCP servers without conflicts" - measurable count
   - SC-003: "under 100ms" - measurable time
   - SC-005: "100% accuracy" - measurable percentage
   - No implementation details (no mention of database technologies, SQL, or specific algorithms)

4. **Acceptance Scenarios**: All three user stories have clear Given-When-Then scenarios that can be tested independently.

5. **Edge Cases**: Five meaningful edge cases identified covering conflicts, data inconsistencies, concurrent updates, and circular dependencies.

6. **Scope Boundary**: The specification clearly defines what's included (table separation, automatic matching, relationship management) and the migration strategy.

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING - Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
