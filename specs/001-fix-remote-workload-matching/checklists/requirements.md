# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Remote Workload Matching

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: PASS
- Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of Python, SQLAlchemy, specific API endpoints)
- Focuses on what the system must do, not how
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All requirements are testable (can verify URL matching, workload persistence, cleanup behavior)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (0% false deletion rate, 100% matching rate, no performance degradation)
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes, not internal system metrics
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with concrete examples
- Edge cases cover error handling, concurrent scenarios, and boundary conditions
- Scope clearly limited to remote workload matching fix, preserving existing container workload behavior

**Feature Readiness**: PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Two user stories cover the primary fix (P1) and secondary registry update scenario (P2)
- Success criteria directly verify the problem is solved (no false deletions, correct matching)
- Specification remains purely behavioral without implementation leakage
