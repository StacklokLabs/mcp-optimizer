# Specification Quality Checklist: Token Savings Metrics for find_tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
✓ Spec focuses on WHAT (token savings metrics) and WHY (demonstrate efficiency gains)
✓ Written for stakeholders to understand value proposition
✓ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria
✓ No code structure or specific library implementations in requirements

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✓ All requirements clearly testable (e.g., FR-001: calculate tokens during ingestion)
✓ No clarification markers present
✓ Success criteria include measurable outcomes (100% of calls, <10ms overhead for savings calculation)
✓ Edge cases identified (no tools, all tools match, serialization variance)
✓ Scope bounded to tool ingestion and find_tool endpoint modifications
✓ Assumptions documented (encoding model, ingestion timing, ephemeral database, response structure)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✓ Single P1 user story with clear acceptance scenarios
✓ Functional requirements map to user story needs
✓ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
✓ Feature is minimal and independently valuable
✓ Performance optimization addressed (token counts calculated once during ingestion, not per query)

### Updates Applied (2025-10-20)
- Clarified token calculation happens during tool ingestion
- Added requirement to persist token count in tool database table
- Documented that database is ephemeral (recreated on each server start)
- Updated success criteria to reflect ingestion-time calculation with query-time aggregation
- Removed redundant recalculation requirement (ingestion handles it)

## Status

**READY FOR PLANNING** ✓

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.
